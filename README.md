description of files
---------------------
 
 tic_tac_toe.js & tic_tac_toe2.js (the improved version!) are standalone JS alert pop-up based 2-player turn based games, that can be placed within a html script to be played, otherwise use JSfiddle.
 
tic_tac_toe.html & tic_tac_toe.css form (a very early dev stage of)  a tic tac toe game, using javascript.
They use the jQuery v2.0.3 min.js Javascript library
